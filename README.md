# DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK PERFORMED:
I have created a Chrome extension for time tracking and productivity analytics using React, Node.js, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS. This extension tracks and calculates the time spent on different websites across Chrome tabs, categorizing them as productive or unproductive based on their nature. It securely stores user activity data in the backend and features a visually appealing dashboard to display time data and detailed weekly productivity reports. This project helps users gain insights into their browsing habits, manage their time effectively, and enhance overall productivity.
